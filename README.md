My friend and I were avid players of the mobile game "Head Soccer" by D&D Dream. This inspired me to create my own PC version with a personal twist: characters that resemble my friends and I, representing our respective countries.

This project was developed using Unity, incorporating a blend of sprites sourced from the internet, elements from the original game, and custom sprites I designed myself. The music, composed by my friend Uri, adds a unique touch. Additionally, in this version, players can get knocked around by the ball more, adding an extra layer of challenge and fun compared to the original game.

All scripts, animations, and other game elements were crafted by me. The game offers two modes:

Single Player: Compete against an AI.
Multiplayer: Local co-op on the same keyboard.

This project required a significant amount of effort, and I hope everyone who tries it enjoys the experience. It's my first attempt at creating a video game, and I'm excited to share it with you.
